# Technical assignment mobile engineer
Make an application that allows the user to view the observed (in the past 30 days) or forecasted (in the future) daily weather conditions for a given location using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs).

You are free to use the tools and frameworks you prefer, however we strongly suggest you keep the hard skills of the job offer in mind.

**Minimal requirements**
* Use React Native

**Timing**

You have 3 weeks to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-). Please ping us when you are done, on this endpoint ([Slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)): `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`. Please mention your name and a link to what we need to review.
